🧠 Key Logic Explained

The calculator uses a state machine logic to track:

1. Number 1:** The first value entered.
2. Operator: The math function chosen (+, -, x, /).
3. Number 2:** The second value entered.

Once the `equal` button is pressed, the strings are converted to `Numbers` and passed through an `operation()` function to return the final result.
